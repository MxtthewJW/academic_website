As such, some have argued that the extent to which observers' rate masculinised male faces as appearing more physically dominant is a useful measure of their ability to detect cues of dominance and threat in other men. We found across 3 studies (total n = 272) that younger, taller, and stronger men showed greater sensitivity to facial cues of dominance. Additionally, participants were more likely to associate younger than older masculinised faces with physical dominance. Self-perceived social dominance did not moderate perceptions. These results contrast with previous work which found that shorter, less socially dominant men had greater ability to detect facial cues of dominance. We propose the hypothesis that younger, more formidable males show greater sensitivity to facial cues of dominance as they are more likely to engage in violent intrasexual competition.","tags":null,"title":"Young, formidable men show greater sensitivity to facial cues of dominance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Despite much of the empirical evidence highlighting the improvements in patients’ outcome from particular psychological therapies (e.g., Hofmann, Asnaani, Vonk, Sawyer \u0026amp; Fang, 2012), there are also significant benefits from non-specific psychotherapy factors which are used across psychotherapies (e.g., Webb, DeRubeis \u0026amp; Barber, 2010). These factors include therapist adherence, the therapeutic alliance, and therapist competence, to name a few (Tschuschke et al., 2015). This essay will focus on the importance of the therapeutic alliance (TA) in benefitting the patient by means of reducing symptoms and distress. The TA involves a collaboration built between therapist and patient (Buchholz \u0026amp; Abramowitz, 2020). The tripartite model of TA dissects this collaboration into a mutually supportive bond, an agreement on treatment goals, and an agreement on the tasks incorporated to reach those goals (Bordin, 1979). In order to justify and argue that the TA is an important component in the delivery of successful psychotherapy, the following argument will be outlined. Firstly, the robust and consistent finding that the TA is associated with psychotherapy outcome will be discussed. Secondly, a potential causal link between TA and patient outcome will be suggested with research that controls for the time at which TA and outcomes are measured. This will additionally shed light on the benefits of forming an early TA in psychotherapy. Thirdly, it will be suggested that the TA itself not only predicts positive psychotherapy outcomes, but additionally moderates the effect of other non-specific therapy factors. Finally, the therapist’s responsiveness to ruptures that arise within the TA may be one mechanism within the delivery of therapy that enhances treatment success.\nThe importance of the therapeutic alliance Patients’ outcomes within psychotherapy have consistently been shown to be moderately related to the TA (Fluckiger, Del Re, Wampold \u0026amp; Horvath, 2018; Horvath, Del Re, Fluckiger \u0026amp; Symonds, 2011; Martin, Garske \u0026amp; Davis, 2000). In a recent meta-analysis based on 295 independent samples which included 100 randomised controlled trials (RCT), Fluckiger et al. (2018) revealed an overall mean weighted effect size between alliance and patient outcome of r = .28. Thus, on average, the greater the TA, the greater the patient outcome. Whilst this effect size is only moderate and accounts for 8% of the total variance, it is greater than that of other non-specific therapist factors, such as therapist competence (i.e., the therapist’s expertise) and therapist adherence (i.e., the extent to which therapists’ adhere to a protocol), with an effect size of .07 and .02, respectively (Webb et al., 2010). Despite this meta-analysis finding high heterogeneity across the data (i.e., high variability), moderation analysis indicated that this was not due to treatment type, as they found no significant differences in effect sizes between psychotherapies. What this may suggest is that the TA is a pan-theoretical factor that can consistently show a robust, moderate relationship with patient outcome. This highlights that therapists should perhaps focus on building a strong TA, as it is a central factor in yielding greater patient outcomes across psychotherapies. Whilst meta-analytic data that measures TA at one particular time point within therapy is important for highlighting its positive relation to therapy outcomes, studies which control for temporal confounds offer more compelling support that a stronger alliance precedes beneficial outcomes (Webb et al., 2012; Zilcha-Mano \u0026amp; Errazuriz, 2015). For instance, Zilcha-Mano and Errazuriz (2015) conducted an RCT with patients allocated to one of several therapist feedback conditions including a condition receiving no feedback. As it would be of ethical concern to allocate patients to a condition whereby the therapist does not attempt to build a TA, the therapist feedback variable offers a similar yet ethical method to conduct such an experiment. Therapist feedback is similar because it enables the dyad to negotiate and collaborate through discussion of the patient’s thoughts, feelings and behaviours, which would build a TA (Zilcha-Mano \u0026amp; Errazuriz, 2015). The researchers assessed TA using the well-established Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; Horvath \u0026amp; Greenberg, 1989), along with patient outcome assessed by overall psychological dysfunction (Lambert et al., 2002). Through controlling for several time points across therapy and previous symptom levels, the RCT found that patients who showed greater TA at a specific time point also showed symptom improvement. This evidence indicates that TA may be causally related to patient outcome as an increase in the TA preceded symptom reduction. Therefore, not only is the TA a pan-theoretical factor that is related to patient outcome, it is perhaps also a way that therapists can deliver a direct improvement in patient outcome.\nDeveloping a strong therapeutic alliance early in therapy An additional insight provided from the aforementioned research is that patients who developed a strong TA earlier in the therapy benefited more in outcome (Zilcha-Mano \u0026amp; Errazuriz, 2015). One explanation for these findings may be that the existing traits or predispositions of some patients are more conducive to forming a strong alliance with the therapist (DeRubeis, Brotman \u0026amp; Gibbons, 2005; Zilcha-Mano, 2017). For example, patients in psychotherapy with insecure or avoidant attachment styles may find it difficult to form the deep and satisfactory relationship necessary for a strong TA early in treatment; whereas, those with a secure attachment style are perhaps less likely to find this problematic (Bowlby, 1988). Empirical evidence supports the idea that insecure representations of the self and others predict a weak TA (Smith, Msetfi \u0026amp; Golding, 2010). Importantly, this suggests that therapists should focus their efforts on developing a TA which places more emphasise on the bond alliance if clients struggle to form a strong relationship (Zilcha-Mano, 2017). For instance, therapist delivery methods can draw on practices taken from cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) as this focuses heavily on the TA (Bennett, Parry \u0026amp; Ryle, 2006). Examples of building a bond alliance in practice may include adopting the language of the patient, and more importantly, acknowledging that the patient-therapist relationship contributes to reinforcing or breaking the patient’s negative interpersonal patterns. Although the empirical support for CAT is limited, there is evidence of successful RCTs even amongst those with complex personality disorders that attribute much of their current distress to past relationships (Calvert \u0026amp; Kellett, 2014). Therefore, the way that the therapist builds a bond alliance with the patient during this early therapy period is an important indicator of beneficial patient outcome.\nThe moderating effects of therapeutic alliance In addition to TA enhancing patients’ outcome directly, it may also operate by indirectly influencing other non-specific therapy elements. The extent to which the therapist follows the therapy protocol is referred to as treatment adherence, and this may be one mechanism that explains how TA facilitates patients’ outcome (Collyer, Eisler \u0026amp; Woolgar, 2018; Tschuschke et al., 2015). In a naturalistic study consisting of 262 therapy sessions using 8 different psychotherapies, Tschuschke and colleagues (2015) examined the relationship between treatment adherence and other common therapy factors including TA. Ratings for treatment adherence were rigorously assessed by therapists and raters who were blind to the motive of the study. The Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ; Bassler, Potratz \u0026amp; Krauthauser, 1995) was used to assess TA, and the scale items were sufficiently correlated, providing a high internal consistency for the scale. The findings revealed that treatment adherence was significantly predicted by TA and the therapist’s competence. Insight from a recent critical review of the TA in exposure therapy for anxiety-related disorders may provide an explanation for how TA moderates the effect of treatment adherence (Buchholz \u0026amp; Abramowitz, 2020). Exposure therapy requires the patient to gradually confront the feared stimuli over several sessions. A strong TA motivates patients to finish exposure therapy sessions, which leads to a reduction in anxiety-related symptoms. The encouragement and support provided by the therapist may therefore be a necessary component in treatment adherence. Whilst Tschuschke and colleagues did not focus on anxiety-related disorders specifically, TA is seen as a non-specific therapeutic factor that can be of benefit across many, if not all, psychotherapies (Barber, Khalsa \u0026amp; Sharpless, 2010; Webb et al., 2012). Therefore, it is useful for therapists to be aware of the indirect, moderating effects of building a TA. This can help tailor the delivery of psychotherapy to the patient’s needs in order to enhance treatment success.\nRuptures and repairs Furthermore, the ruptures and repairs that occur within therapy are one of the potential underlying mechanisms that improve the TA and patient outcome (Eubanks, Muran \u0026amp; Safran, 2018; Safran, Muran \u0026amp; Eubanks, 2011). A rupture is a breakdown in TA, often due to a challenging emotional bond, a disagreement on the therapy goals, or a dispute over the therapy tasks (Safran \u0026amp; Muran, 2000). Meta-analytic research has indicated that the occurrence of ruptures which are then resolved (i.e., rupture-repair) are moderately associated with positive patient outcome (Safran et al., 2011). Additionally, outcomes can be improved through rupture-repair training (Eubanks et al., 2018). Based on these findings, there are research-supported practices that therapists can deliver to benefit the client. For example, a therapist should be alert to potential ruptures, which may be apparent through patient hostility or dissatisfaction. More so, the therapist should empathise with the client and take responsibility for their contribution to ruptures (Eubanks et al., 2018). These therapeutic practices within the alliance may be inextricably linked to therapist responsiveness (i.e., adapting to the patient’s behaviour; Webb et al., 2010). Thus, ruptures that occur throughout psychotherapy which are dealt with by the therapist’s responsive behaviour will develop the TA, which may provide the necessary understanding and collaboration to reduce the patient’s difficulties.\nConclusion In summary, it is clear that the therapist’s delivery of treatment can benefit from forming a strong TA. Despite other common therapist factors, such as therapist competence, contributing to psychotherapy success, an abundance of meta-analytic research has highlighted the robust association between TA and improved outcomes for patients. What is more, the therapist not only enhances patients’ outcomes through improving the dyadic relationship, but additionally through increasing adherence to treatment. Research which has measured TA and patient outcome across the duration of psychotherapy has indicated that TA may well precede symptom reduction in patients. Additionally, this line of research suggests that those who form a strong TA early in therapy benefit more in outcome. Nevertheless, an important aspect of establishing a strong TA is based on the therapist’s responsiveness to ruptures that will inevitably arise throughout psychotherapy. Taken together, the aforementioned research suggests that patients’ difficulties can be reduced by the therapist delivering psychotherapy in a manner that is conducive to improving the TA.\n","date":1583107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"ee297f9c30667b0ed8054c9e24ab707c","permalink":"/essay/therapeutic-alliance/","publishdate":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/essay/therapeutic-alliance/","section":"essay","summary":"TA is an important component in the delivery of successful psychotherapy.","tags":null,"title":"How can the way that psychological therapy is delivered by the therapist enhance the benefits for the patient?","type":"essay"},{"authors":null,"categories":"R","content":" During a summer internship, I collected data for an experiment investigating the relationship between physical and social dominance under the topic of intrasexual competition.\nThis was the first RMarkdown I’d produced.

This mean column (MeanGrip) is then binded to the original dataset using cbind.\nNext, a mean score for each participant is created for the items in the social dominance scale questionnaire. Again, this (MeanDominance) is binded to the dataset.\n Checking data with histograms and correlations ggplot(data=sizing_2) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = MeanDominance), breaks = seq(1, 7, 0.5), na.rm=T)  ggplot(data=sizing_2) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = ppt_age), na.rm = T)  Here, the data can be checked with the histogram to see if mean dominance on the questionnaire is normally distributed and helps identify any outliers. The second histogram shows that the age range and density amongst these 105 participants is high. This is beneficial as it enables us to make interpretations on all age groups as opposed to a limited age sample (as is often the case with psychology studies).\nggplot(data = sizing_2, mapping = aes(x = MeanGrip, y = ppt_bicep_circumference_cm), na.rm = T) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)  cor.test(sizing_2$MeanGrip, sizing_2$ppt_bicep_circumference_cm) ## ## Pearson\u0026#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sizing_2$MeanGrip and sizing_2$ppt_bicep_circumference_cm ## t = 4.993, df = 103, p-value = 2.432e-06 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2728622 0.5837184 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.4414409 The Pearson’s r correlation between grip strength and bicep circumference is nothing more than a sanity check.

However, this may not necessarily indicate that there is no effect; it may be that only a small effect is apparent and a larger sample is required to detect the relationship.

For bicep circumference, the 95% CI was lower, so an r-scale of 1/15 is better.\nThe BF analysis revealed that only height had a BF which was more likely in favour of our hypothesis than the null hypothesis (BF = 1.29). However, this BF is still extremely low and typically a BF of 3 is considered the minimum for accepting the hypothesis over the null hypothesis. Therefore, the physical measurements based on Bayesian analysis do not seem to be related to perceived social dominance.\n Final comments These analysis suggest that our data has failed to find a relationship between physical and social dominance. This relationship has been assessed through Pearson’s r, linear regression, and Bayes Factor analysis; whilst the reliability was tested using Cronbach’s Alpha.\n ","date":1566267194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566267194,"objectID":"404f00b6708cb151657f55dcdc49949b","permalink":"/rstatistics/rmarkdown-on-dominance/","publishdate":"2019-08-19T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/rstatistics/rmarkdown-on-dominance/","section":"rstatistics","summary":"During a summer internship, I collected data for an experiment investigating the relationship between physical and social dominance under the topic of intrasexual competition.\nThis was the first RMarkdown I’d produced.","tags":["R Markdown","PCA","Bayesian Analysis"],"title":"The relationship between physical \u0026 social dominance","type":"rstatistics"},{"authors":["Matthew Waddington"],"categories":null,"content":"What’s one of the main worries people have about getting old?

Andrew went through a series of brain scans and psychological testing and the doctor diagnosed him with fronto-temporal dementia.\nTwo cases of dementia, two completely different experiences. The first case relates to classical memory problems whereby knowledge of events and facts become more difficult to remember. Whereas, Andrew’s case is to do with unusual acts of behaviour and personality changes. These are two of the many faces of dementia.\nScientifically speaking, each of these faces are one of several neurodegenerative diseases. For anyone interested in the brain areas involved in the two cases we described, Jane was likely to have problems in the hippocampal and medial temporal lobe areas [2]. On the other hand, Andrew was likely to have issues in the frontal lobe region of the brain [3]. So it’s not just the symptoms that differ, but the brain areas that are affected too.\nEven then, each face of dementia has its own complications. The case from Jane may be typical of Alzheimer’s disease, but the symptoms do not always involve memory loss. A scientific study with nearly 1000 patients found that 57% of those with Alzheimer’s disease did not show memory loss symptoms [4]. Instead, they showed difficulty with language, executing actions, and visual ability. If not classical memory problems, what is it then that determines whether someone has Alzheimer’s disease or not?\nAs you can see, one of the major difficulties in this kind of science is finding the balance between reaching a diagnosis and picking up on the nuance within each type of dementia. Right now, the only way to truly know what type of dementia someone has is to examine the brain tissue after death. Hardly useful for making a plan of action!\nIf you’re still reading this, it may be because you know someone personally with dementia (or you’re all just a curious bunch!). Has a doctor ever refused to give that person a diagnosis of a certain type of dementia? Or even given a general diagnosis of dementia?\nThis leads us to another really important point. That is, those with suspected dementia need to be able to complete the testing in order to get a diagnosis. Otherwise, they’re likely left with a general label of cognitive impairment. The unfortunate truth is that a diagnosis is unlikely to be useful and accurate when the testing cannot be completed, and it’s often a sign that the disease has progressed too far to act upon it.\nWith that being said, all hope is not lost. For some types of dementia, such as Parkinson’s disease, there are effective medications that can help with the symptoms. A couple of the main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include a lack of movement control and stiffness in bodily limbs. For some patients, the prescribed medicine can really help take these symptoms away [5]. And it’s not just medication. Fascinatingly, there is even research to show that music and dance can help manage these symptoms and improve quality of life [6]. Time to get your gran to do the cha-cha slide!\nSo, to get back to the first question, how do we prevent dementia? The truth is, there won’t be a cure for dementia. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Rather, scientists are working on treatments to slow and maybe even prevent each type of dementia. Research in areas such as early detection of dementia and drug treatment is promising [7]. This gives those suffering an opportunity to act upon early warning signs and then they may well remember their grandson’s 18th birthday party. Now, that would be something to celebrate.\nReferences\n World Health Organisation (2020, September 21).

Clinically, memory impairment, especially episodic memory, is often the earliest and most prominent symptom in AD (McKhann et al., 2011). This clinical presentation is in line with the proposed neuropathological changes which, according to the Braak stages, begins with atrophy from neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the transentorhinal cortex and progressively spreads throughout the medial temporal lobes (MTL) and into neocortical regions (Braak \u0026amp; Braak, 1991). As many AD patients adhere to this clinical and neuropathological progression, it could be stated that AD is a unitary disorder. However, despite this typical pattern, there are a significant amount of AD patients who present atypical and non-amnesic subtypes which do not conform to the Braak stages (Galton, Patterson, Xuereb \u0026amp; Hodges, 2000; Murray et al., 2011; Peter et al., 2014). Therefore, the following essay will argue that AD should not be considered as a unitary disorder because of the high heterogeneity in clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological presentations. Firstly, post-mortem research will show that neuropathological change can progress in regions outside of the MTL. Secondly, data-driven analysis will reveal amnesic and non-amnesic AD clinical clusters. Thirdly, converging findings from clinical and neuroimaging research will shed light on AD variation. Finally, the distinct features of early-onset AD and late-onset AD will suggest that a unitary view of AD is incomplete.\nNeuropathological evidence Seminal post-mortem research as well as meta-analytic data indicate that the neuropathology distribution may not necessarily follow the typical AD progression as proposed by the Braak stages (Ferreira, Nordberg \u0026amp; Westman, 2020; Murray et al., 2011). In 889 post-mortem AD cases, Murray and colleagues (2011) measured the density of NFTs and senile plaques in each brain to determine underlying AD pathology. Post-mortem analysis ascertains that all cases were of AD because pathology can be analysed at the cellular level. A quantitative algorithm classified each case into three distinct subtypes: typical, hippocampal-spared, and limbic-predominant. The latter two subtypes are atypical neuropathology distributions and accounted for 25% of all cases. The typical cases had a higher count of NFTs in the transentorhinal cortex and MTL, which follows the Braak stages. In contrast, the hippocampal-spared and limbic-predominant subtypes showed increased NFT density in neocortical regions and in limbic regions including the amygdala, respectively. This suggests that AD does not necessarily present with atrophy in the MTL as a noteworthy proportion of confirmed cases show preservation in these areas and NFT burden outside of the MTL. Thus, AD pathology does not always adhere to a single distribution.\nClinical presentations of AD Following from this, the neuropathology distribution is thought to govern the AD clinical symptoms (Galton et al., 2000). Therefore, clinical symptom variability should also be apparent. A systematic review of 8 studies with over 4000 probable AD subjects shows differential clinical presentations using cluster analysis (Martorelli, Sudo \u0026amp; Charchat-Fichman, 2019). Cluster analysis provides an unbiased, data-driven approach to identify distinct cognitive patterns within neuropsychological data which is often assessed with the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). The MMSE is an extensively used neuropsychological test for assessing global cognitive impairment with domains including attention, orientation, memory, language and visuospatial skills (Folstein, Folstein \u0026amp; McHugh, 1975). The general review findings show that AD patients not only cluster into the typical memory impairment subtypes, but a significant amount also cluster into groups with relatively spared memory or present more global cognitive deficits which is not explained by disease severity (e.g., Davidson et al., 2010; Stopford, Snowden, Thompson \u0026amp; Neary, 2008). These results refute the unitary view that AD cases only present with focal memory impairments. To elaborate on these findings, one strong methodological study within the review used latent class analysis with data from 938 probable AD patients (Scheltens et al., 2016). A battery of neuropsychological tests was analysed and the MMSE was used as a covariate to account for clustering of cognitive impairment severity. This provides more confidence that differences within and between the cognitive domains were revealed rather than being attributed to disease progression. Three main subtypes were identified: 2 memory-impaired clusters (i.e., mild or moderate amnesic AD patients), 3 memory-spared clusters (i.e., deficits in language and visuospatial ability, deficits in executive function, and deficits exclusively in visuospatial ability) and 3 memory-indifferent clusters (i.e., variants of global cognitive deficits). Whilst the memory-impaired clusters included the most patients (43%), the atypical clusters (i.e., memory-spared and memory-indifferent) accounted for the majority of patients’ clinical presentations when combined (57%). Therefore, AD does not necessarily present with focal memory deficits, which is supported in additional cluster analyses (Peter et al., 2014; Ralph, Patterson, Graham, Dawson \u0026amp; Hodges, 2003; Qiu, Jacobs, Messer, Salmon \u0026amp; Feldman, 2019). Taken together, data-driven research supports heterogeneity in AD symptoms to reveal a multifaceted disorder.\nNeuroimaging evidence Neuroimaging evidence that maps brain atrophy onto clinical symptoms offers converging support that the AD subtypes are truly heterogeneous (Kate et al., 2018; Taler \u0026amp; Phillips, 2008). Across three independent datasets with 707 prodromal AD and AD cases, a data-driven cluster analysis classified brain atrophy using structural MRI and clinical symptoms into subgroups (Kate et al., 2018). Both prodromal AD and AD cases had underlying amyloid pathology (i.e., an AD biomarker; Dubois et al., 2014), with the former having a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. The statistical analysis revealed four subtypes with distinct brain atrophy and clinical presentations. Those with medial-temporal atrophy had the lowest memory and language scores. Cases of parieto-occipital atrophy had poor visuospatial and executive scores. In addition, the mild atrophy subgroup had the highest global cognition scores, and the diffuse atrophy subgroup displayed atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes and presented low memory scores yet average cognitive scores in other domains. Firstly, these results show that underlying brain atrophy maps onto distinct clinical symptoms which provides more support for genuine variation in AD. Secondly, these subtypes can even be distinguished in prodromal AD, despite the neurodegeneration being in the earliest stage when it is less apparent. Thus, brain atrophy is consistent with clinical symptoms in indicating a disease that has multiple degeneration pathways.\nClinical presentations do not always match the brain atrophy It is noteworthy to state that the cognitive domain that is intended to be clinically assessed does not always correspond to the expected brain atrophy (Stopford, Thompson, Neary, Richardson \u0026amp; Snowden, 2012; Joubert et al., 2016). This limitation of clinical assessment is clear in Stopford and colleagues’ (2012) work, in which they assessed AD patients along with fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) patients who have prominent frontal lobe dysfunction. AD patients can show similar clinical deficits to those with FTD, displaying poor performance on working memory and executive tasks such as planning, inhibition, and attention (Lafleche \u0026amp; Albert, 1995; Perry, Watson \u0026amp; Hodges, 2000). As these tasks are associated with frontal lobe functions, this reinforces the idea that AD patients can suffer from frontal lobe pathology. However, AD patients do not often show the personality and behavioural impairments which are characteristic symptoms of FTD and therefore of frontal dysfunction. More so, comparison of executive task performance between AD and FTD has highlighted, upon close examination, that whilst FTD patients show problems with attention and response inhibition, AD patients seem to perform poorly on these tasks because of poor short-term memory load. Short-term memory capacity is functionally localised to temporo-parietal regions, which suggests that this may be the primary deficit in executive tasks, rather than a frontal deficit (Stopford et al., 2012). A low sensitivity in neuropsychological testing may therefore lead to incorrect claims of the brain atrophy. Whilst this is an important shortcoming of some neuropsychological testing, the aforementioned research shows that an extensive neuropsychology test battery along with neuroimaging and neuropathology evidence strongly suggests against a single presentation of AD (e.g., Kate et al., 2018; Martorelli et al., 2019; Murray et al., 2011).\nWhat can early-onset Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease tell us? Furthermore, early-onset AD (EOAD; \u0026lt;65 years old) and late-onset AD (LOAD; \u0026gt;65 years old) reveal important clinical variability that would be overlooked if AD was considered a unitary disorder. EOAD is usually characterised by non-amnesic deficits as well as presenting with atrophy outside of the hippocampus and MTL (Koedam et al., 2010; Poulakis et al., 2018; Stopford et al., 2012). In contrast to this, LOAD follows a more typical AD presentation with memory impairment being the primary deficit, along with temporal lobe atrophy (Frisoni et al., 2007). In support of this difference, Joubert and colleagues (2016) assessed 40 EOAD and LOAD patients, who provided biomarker evidence of amyloid pathology, on an extensive battery of neuropsychological testing. AD patients were age- and education-matched to healthy controls. The relevant findings revealed that EOAD patients performed more poorly than LOAD patients on executive and visuoconstructional tasks. LOAD patients were significantly more impaired in semantic memory, with 100% of cases reaching the threshold for clinical impairment (i.e., -1.96 SD) compared to only 50% of EOAD cases. More so, LOAD patients had a marginally significant greater impairment in episodic memory tasks. Caution should be taken when interpreting non-significant findings (Makin \u0026amp; Tamar, 2019), but there is reason to believe that LOAD patients are more impaired than EOAD patients in episodic memory. Firstly, a strict correction method was used which may have resulted in a type 2 error. Secondly, as mentioned, EOAD is usually characterised by non-amnesic deficits so a greater memory performance would be expected when compared to LOAD. These characteristic features between age groups suggest that LOAD may be similar to typical AD. However, EOAD presents with contrasting deficits which cannot be explained by a unitary view of AD.\nConclusion In summary, the clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathology evidence discussed indicates that AD may well have multiple subtypes rather than reflecting a single disorder. Post-mortem research has shown that the distribution of neuropathology in AD does not necessarily follow the Braak stages. Systematic research of cluster analyses has revealed that whilst memory impairment is a prominent subtype of AD, there are important subtypes with focal non-amnesic deficits. More so, converging evidence from neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing supports the notion that AD, and even prodromal AD, present with multiple subtypes. Finally, the distinct features of EOAD and LOAD indicates that a unitary view of AD is insufficient at explaining this variation.\n","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583884800,"objectID":"2a162a86a210a4ee26db7b5c37aa0fd3","permalink":"/essay/ad-essay/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/essay/ad-essay/","section":"essay","summary":"The following essay will argue that AD should not be considered as a unitary disorder because of the high variation in clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological presentations.","tags":null,"title":"To what extent should Alzheimer’s Disease be considered a unitary disorder?","type":"essay"}]
