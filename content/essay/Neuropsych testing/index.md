title: Neuropsychological assessment from an experimental neuropsychologist's view 
---
## Introduction

Neuropsychological assessment plays a central role in identifying, assisting, and treating patients with suspected brain abnormalities (Zillmer, Spiers & Culbertson, 2008). To illustrate the considerations an experimental neuropsychologist (EN) would take to investigate neuropsychological functioning, a case example is given whereby a patient (“Patient A”) has performed significantly lower than a group of controls in a neuropsychological test. This essay firstly discusses the psychometric properties of neuropsychological testing. Secondly, the standard test battery approach shows how Patient A’s performance can be further investigated. Finally, the interpretation methods offer an insight into the clinical significance of Patient A’s underperformance.

## Psychometrics

Psychometrics are concerned with the measurement of human traits and abilities using a standardised approach (Zillmer et al., 2008). The reliability and validity of a test significantly contributes to its utility as a measure. Reliability refers to the consistency of a test score on repeated measurements from the same person (Zillmer et al., 2008). Internal consistency, measured commonly with Cronbach’s alpha, is one measure of reliability that shows the degree to which each item in the test scale measures the same construct. For instance, if it were found that the items within the neuropsychological test provided to Patient A measured different cognitive functions (i.e., low internal consistency), it would indicate that the items are assessing different cognitive constructs. Validity is the ability of the test to truly measure what it was intended to measure (Zillmer et al., 2008). For example, the National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson & Willison, 1991) has been used to measure a patient’s premorbid ability (i.e., intelligence prior to cognitive dysfunction). The NART has high criterion validity because it correlates highly with other measures of intelligence (Crawford, 2003). Therefore, the EN would ensure that the test administered is highly reliable and valid before further investigating Patient A’s underperformance.

## The hierarchy of neuropsychology

Before the EN can interpret Patient A’s performance, a series of neuropsychological tests should be administered. A test in isolation cannot infer much unless it is placed within the context of a test battery (Zillmer et al., 2008). Test batteries assess several cognitive domains which include, but are not limited to, language, intelligence, motor speed, memory, abstract reasoning, and constructional ability (Zillmer & Green, 2006). Test batteries are important for at least two reasons. Firstly, a single test needs to be placed within the context of the individual’s profile to assess cognitive strengths and weaknesses which may assist with therapeutic interventions (Lezak, Howieson & Loring, 2012). Secondly, neuropsychological functioning operates hierarchically. Such that the most fundamental cognitive functions like orientation, sensation and perception are prerequisites to higher-order cognitive functions (e.g., memory, judgement, problem-solving). This second point is particularly important because if Patient A’s basic functions were neurologically impaired, this would impact more complex cognitive systems. This may lead to a neuropsychological test revealing a higher-order deficit (e.g., visuospatial organisation) when it is in fact a fundamental neurological dysfunction (e.g., perception). 

## Experimental approaches

Two main experimental approaches are commonly used in practice (Bigler, 2007). The standard test battery approach (STB) evaluates all basic neuropsychological abilities (Zillmer et al., 2008); whereas the process approach adapts the assessment to the individual patient’s needs. Whilst the process approach is flexible and considers the unique presentation of each case, it may lead to confirmation bias and poor standardisation as a result of no objective standard (Meehl, 1973). Noteworthily, the STB also has downfalls. For instance, it does not question why a patient underperformed and reduces cognition and behaviour to a single value (Zillmer et al., 2008). However, as an EN, the STB would be recommended since the purpose is to investigate Patient A’s performance which requires objective comparison to the control group.

## Interpretation of neuropsychological assessment

The interpretation of neuropsychological test results is supported by statistical transformation into standardised scores (Crawford, 2003). Standardised test scores should be obtained from a representative sample who provide the normative data (forming the normal distribution; Kessels & Hendriks, 2016). An example of a standardised score is the z-score which converts raw scores into standard deviation units. Therefore, Patient A’s test scores should be standardised so that it can be compared to normative data. Pattern analysis can then examine the relationship between the test battery scores at an individual and group level (Zillmer et al., 2008). Importantly, standard scores are based on a sample which is by definition only a subset of the population. For instance, Patient A may have performed significantly worse than the group as a result of a truncated distribution. These distributions arise when certain subgroups are excluded from the sample (Brooks, Sherman, Iverson, Slick & Strauss, 2011). If certain participants are excluded (e.g., due to cognitive impairment), the distribution will contain a higher proportion of those with higher-percentile cognitive functioning compared to the population. In Patient A’s case, this may lead to their performance erroneously classified as poor. The EN should therefore caution interpretation until the sample characteristics of the test are thoroughly understood.

A final interpretative method used by the EN is a measure of Patient A’s premorbid ability. The NART can be used as a premorbid ability measure since it requires little demand on one’s cognitive capacity - only oral reading of short, single, irregular words is needed (Nelson & Willison, 1991). The idea is that irregular words violate the expected pronunciation which implies prior knowledge of the word is needed (i.e., crystallised intelligence; Zillmer et al., 2008). When the NART is combined with demographic factors such as education level and age, it provides the best past performance indication (Bright & van der Linde, 2018). Therefore, administering the NART to Patient A after accounting for key demographic factors offers an insight into potential cognitive changes that may have led to the test underperformance.

## Conclusion

The EN should follow these critical steps to further investigate Patient A’s performance. Firstly, the psychometric properties of the test should be established. Following this, the STB approach can test across cognitive domains. Finally, test scores should be standardised to compare across each test as well as to the control group whilst considering the associated challenges.
